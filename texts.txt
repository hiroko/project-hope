Know your condition inside out! Doctors are great, but they very often don't understand the details of your condition.  You need to make sure you don't slip through the cracks of the healthcare system, and make sure you get what you need.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Kel</small>
Hang on tight! You are in for a roller coaster ride of emotions! Find a support group, learn as much as you can and ask questions!!<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Jaclyn</small>
Write everything down! Don't settle on one opinion, get multiple opinions before setting on a surgeon.  I'm glad we got the second opinion, and I believe it saved my son's life.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Michelle</small>

Do not let it define you.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Melinda</small>
Do not let it define you. I feel very strongly about this. My AVM is painful and not pleasant on the eyes, but I never let it hold me back. I don't feel sorry for myself. Also, don't let the negative reactions from uniformed individuals get to you. An AVM may be painful and uncomfortable, but it also can build a strong character in a person. It has for me.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Melinsa</small>
Ask lots of questions, insure you are being treated by a doctor who specializes in this condition.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Tam</small>

Get the facts from your doctor. Do not self-Google. Be aware of your condition but don't neglect living your life.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Anita</small>
You can get through this. Believe in yourself.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> October Miracle</small>
