Know your condition inside out! Doctors are great, but they very often don't understand the details of your condition.  You need to make sure you don't slip through the cracks of the healthcare system, and make sure you get what you need.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Kel</small>
Hang on tight! You are in for a roller coaster ride of emotions! Find a support group, learn as much as you can and ask questions!!<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Jaclyn</small>
Write everything down! Don't settle on one opinion, get multiple opinions before setting on a surgeon.  I'm glad we got the second opinion, and I believe it saved my son's life.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Michelle</small>

It's possible to live a normal life with an AVM, and live in the present, but never stop trying to improve.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Ann</small>
Listen to your body, and keep pushing for answers.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Mila</small>
Do not let it define you.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Melinda</small>
Do not let it define you. I feel very strongly about this. My AVM is painful and not pleasant on the eyes, but I never let it hold me back. I don't feel sorry for myself. Also, don't let the negative reactions from uniformed individuals get to you. An AVM may be painful and uncomfortable, but it also can build a strong character in a person. It has for me.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Melinsa</small>
Ask lots of questions, insure you are being treated by a doctor who specializes in this condition.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Tam</small>
Be strong. Ask a lot of questions. Get as much info from doctors that you can.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Wonder</small>

Get the facts from your doctor. Do not self-Google. Be aware of your condition but don't neglect living your life.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Anita</small>
You can get through this. Believe in yourself.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> October Miracle</small>
You must find the new you.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Michelle</small>
It's scary and hard, but "always remember you are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think."<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Michelle</small>

When you think you are not strong enough (and believe me, I wanted to give up), you will be surprised at what you can handle.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Sarah</small>
Go with the flow and try to stay calm.  You are strong, and you can handle this.<br><small><i class="fa fa-heart fa-md fa-fw"></i> Sarah</small>
